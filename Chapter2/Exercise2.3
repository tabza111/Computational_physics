'''Exercise:2.3: Write a program to perform the inverse operation to that o example 2.2. That is, ask the user for the Cartesian coordinates x, y of a point in two-dimensional space, and calculate and print the corresponding polar coordinates, with the angle theta given in degrees '''

from math import sqrt as sqt, atan, pi
x=float(input("Enter x:")
y=float(input("Enter y:"))

r=sqt(x**2+y**2)
theta=atan(y/x)  # from radian to degree
theta_deg=theta*180/pi
print("r=",r,"Theta=",theta_deg,"\u00b0")
