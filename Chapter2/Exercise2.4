'''Exercise:2.4: A spaceship travels from earth in a straight line at relativistic speed v to another planet x light years away. Write a program to ask the user the value of x and the speed v as a fraction of speed of light c, then print out the time in years to reach its destination. (a) In the rest frame of the obserber on earth and (b) as perceived by a passenger on board the ship. Use your program to calculate the answers for a planet 10 light years away with v=0.99c'''
